+Description
+===========
+
+This pure Lua library implements the client side HTTP/2 protocol, but not all
+details are covered, for example, the stream dependencies is maintained but
+never used.
+
+There are some inherent limitations which are not solved, however.
+
+**Relation between Cosocket object and HTTP/2 session**. HTTP/2 protocol is
+designed to take over a TCP connection persistently, while Cosocket object is
+request-related, which cannot be used cross the request bound. This library is
+detached from the specific Cosocket object, in other words, which Cosocket
+object should be used is depend on callers, thus the connection underlying the
+Cosocket object might be reused over and over time. However, the HTTP/2 session
+should be binded to only a connection since HTTP/2 session is stateful,
+especially when you have multiple connections to the same server.
+
+When a Cosocket object is created, which alive connection will be selected
+isn't determinate, so which HTTP/2 session should be used is unknow.
